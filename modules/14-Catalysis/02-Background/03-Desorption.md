Desorption is the reverse of adsorption, where adsorbed complexes dissociate, liberating one or more fluid-phase species and active sites.  Modeled as a chemical reaction, the desorption of adsorbed molecule A would be represented as follows:

$A*S \rightarrow A + S$ 

(Note that this is the reverse of the first [adsorption](./Adsorption) reaction).  The same rules of kinetics and thermodynamics apply to adsorption events, just as they do to other chemical reactions in general.

Desorption can also involve multiple adsorbed species-site complexes, such as

$2H*S \rightarrow H_2 + 2S$ 

(which is the reverse of dissociative adsorption).

Note that in both of these cases, molecular species are returned to the gas phase and previously bound-up active sites are now open to participating in more chemical events.
