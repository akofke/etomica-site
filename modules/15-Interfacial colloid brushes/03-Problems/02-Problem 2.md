Set &epsilon;<sub>MonMon</sub> equal to 0.1 k<sub>B</sub>T, Îµ<sub>SurfCol</sub> (wall epsilon in the module) equal to 1.5 k<sub>B</sub>T, the reduced temperature to 2.0, and all other parameters as in Problem 1. Repeat the simulations describe in Problem 1. How are the solvent conditions changing for the grafted polymer chains compared to the conditions chosen in Problem 1? How do the results for the probability of observing the adsorption of the colloidal brush as a function of the length of the grafted chains change compared to those obtained in Problem 1? Is colloidal adsorption more or less likely to occur as the grafted polymer chain length increases? Can you use the results for the density distribution of polymer segments within the simulation box to explain your results?
