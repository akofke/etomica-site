At low pressures, the amount adsorbed is given by:

$$
\theta \simeq KP_A
$$

where K is the equilibrium constant for the adsorption process ([Langmuir](Adsorption/Langmuir)).

1. For $\epsilon = 7.5$, at each of T = 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1, use simulations to determine 
the pressure range over which the adsorption isotherm is linear, and measure its slope.  (Hint: at T=1.0, this
is the same problem as done in [Example 1](Adsorption/Example_1).

2. From these data, you should be able to determine the standard molar enthalpy and entropy of adsorption
at low coverage, using the van't Hoff equation:

$$
 \ln\frac{K(T_2)}{K(T_1)} = -\frac{\Delta H^\circ}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
$$

and the relationship 

$$
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ = -RT\ln K
$$

3. How does your enthapy of adsorption compare with the wall-fluid interaction strength?  Also, explain the
sign (positive or negative) of your value for the entropy.
