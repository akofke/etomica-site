##BET analysis
In this problem, you will determine how well the BET model describes our simple adsorbate system.

1.  Obtain isotherms up to $P/P_0$ at both T=0.90 and T=1.0 for $\epsilon = 5.0$ 
and $\epsilon = 7.5$, as in [Example 1](<../Examples/Example 1>).  How do they differ?

2.  Make "BET plots" of $1/[A(ads)](P_0/P - 1)$ vs $P/P_0$ (see [BET model](Adsorption/BET model) for details)
for each of your data sets.  Obtain values for $C$ and $[S]_0$ in each case, by fitting
a line to data between 0.05 < $P/P_0$ 0.30.  (Make sure to have several measured points in this
region of the isotherms!

3.  How similar are the values of the monolayer capacity obtained?

4.  The quantity $C$ should be proportional to $e^{E_a/kT}$.  How well do your
data fit this relation?
