* Based on the paper referenced in the “Algorithm” section, identify the mathematical form of the force field for the various intra- and intermolecular interactions within a SAM structure.

* Compare the calculated mechanical properties of the SAM structure to experimental data in Joyce, S.A. and Houston, J.E. (1991). "A new force sensor incorporating force-feedback control for interfacial force microscopy," Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62, 710-715.
