*These problems are suitable for more advanced students in a graduate thermo. course or a statistical mechanics course*

**Problem 1.**

Using the data of [Level 1](PistonCylinder/Problems/Level 1) Problem 2, estimate the coefficient of thermal expansion for this fluid. 

**Problem 2.**

Devise an experiment that can be used to measure the heat capacity of the fluid. Apply it to evaluate the heat capacity of the ideal-gas fluid, and then of the repulsion-attraction fluid at 600 K.

**Problem 3.**

Develop an expression for the resulting density and temperature of an ideal gas that undergoes an irreversible expansion from 1000 bar, 1000 K to 100 bar. Perform a simulation of this process and compare the results to your formulas.
