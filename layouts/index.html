                <b>Etomica</b> is an open-source molecular simulation framework written in Java. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is modular in design, providing many choices for the simulation elements, including:  
                sampling algorithm;  spatial dimension; molecular model (including both hard and soft potentials); and properties for measurement. 
                Simulation components are easily extended to develop new capabilities.  In addition to allowing for conventional batch simulations, 
                Etomica is unique in enabling construction of interactive simulations, with a rich set of tools to manipulate, view, and interrogate the simulation as it runs. 
                Etomica is unique also in providing capabilities for calculating thermodynamic virial coefficients efficiently and accurately.
