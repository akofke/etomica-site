##Interactions in the adsorbed monolayer

Henry's Law behavior requires that particles adsorbed on the surface don't interact
with each other, which is not the case for higher coverages.  In this problem you will 
look at such effects.

1.  At T = 0.9, $\epsilon = 7.5$, run simulations at log(P) = -4.5, -4.0,
-3.5 and -3.0.  At each pressure, obtain the average adsorption and the average potential
energy of the simulation.

2.  Determine the average potential energy per adsorbed particle (note that the surface
area is 64 (8x8) in the atomic-diameter units used in the simulation (see [Simulation model](Adsorption/Simulation_model)).  

3.  Each surface-particle interaction is worth 7.5 energy units. Use this to determine the
average energy of interaction between a particle and its neighbors.   Explain how this
changes as the coverage increases.
