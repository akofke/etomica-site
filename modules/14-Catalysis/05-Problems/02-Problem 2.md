2. Postulate a catalytic mechanism for catalyst A.  To accomplish this task, it may be useful to try to view individual events and answer individual questions with the simulation module, such as:
:a. How does CO adsorb?  Molecularly or dissociatively?  Can you visualize the adsorption event?  Describe it in words.
:b. How does O<sub>2</sub> adsorb? Molecularly or dissociatively?  Can you visualize the adsorption event?  Describe it in words.
:c. Can you visualize the surface reaction happening?  (You may need to slow down the simulation delay to “see” this happen.)  Describe it in words.
:d. Show, by way of derivation, how this mechanism leads to the same rate law equation, with the same concentration dependence, as in problems #1.  Be sure to state all assumptions that you make during your derivation.
:e. Compare your catalytic mechanistic model to the simulation data you collected for one case (one set of reactant concentrations) of CO oxidation on catalyst A at 600 K.  Regress and compare parameters (kinetic, thermodynamic) as part of your comparison.
