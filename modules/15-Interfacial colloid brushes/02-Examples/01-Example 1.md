Set Îµ<sub>MonMon</sub> equal to 1 k<sub>B</sub>T. Set the number of grated polymer chains to 8, the length of each grafted chain to 20 segments, the reduced temperature to 3, and the size of the simulation box to 30. As the simulation progresses discuss the probability density distribution for the colloid throughout the simulation box: what do you observe?
