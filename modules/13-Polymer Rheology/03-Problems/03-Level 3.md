Non-Traditional Flows

Problem 1: Use the parameter setting of a = 0.5, b = 0 and 1, and chain length = 10 to make plots of the material function as a function of flow rate.

Problem 2: Use the parameter setting of a = -0.5, b = 0 and 1, and chain length = 10 to make plots of the material function as a function of flow rate.

Problem 3: For a given chain length and non-linear force strength, suggest a set of functions that would describe the material properties for all two-dimensional flow types and all flow rates.  This set of functions would depend on both the flow rate and the flow-type parameter.
