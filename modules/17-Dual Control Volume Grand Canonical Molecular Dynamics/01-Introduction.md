This module presents an interactive molecular simulation of the diffusion process. Our simulation uses a Dual Control Volume Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics (DCVGCMD) simulation.  The simulation presented here allows the user to see the molecules diffuse as a way to equalize the chemical potential of the system.  Steady state is achieved when the flux of each species is the same.  This simulation allows the user to change the temperature.  The temperature change can then be shown to cause a change in flux of the system.  This simulation also allows the user to see how the density profile of the system develops.  Further information concerning diffusion and the simulation can be found in the background sections.
