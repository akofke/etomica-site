3.  Determine the heat of reaction for CO oxidation on catalyst A via a calorimetry experiment.  To accomplish this, you will want to run the reactor in adiabatic mode, and use a suitable energy balance (or combined mole and energy balance).  Relevant mean heat capacity data is given below:

$$
\bar C_{P,CO} = 34.1 \frac {J}{mol*K}
$$

$\bar C_{P,O_2} = 36.0 \frac {J}{mol*K}$

$\bar C_{P,CO_2} = 57.4 \frac {J}{mol*K}$
 		 		 

Keep in mind that you do not need to let the reaction run to completion to accomplish this task (the simulation may take too long to run).  For accuracy, it is recommended to try and stop the reaction at a configuration where there is little or no material absorbed on the catalyst surface (all atoms and molecules in the gas phase).
