To quantify the extent of reaction of a given system, at least one or more mole balances are required.  For the general reaction

$aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD$ 

one could write a mole balance on A, assuming it was the limiting reactant.  For the specific case of batch reactor, with no net flow of moles into or out of the reactor

$\frac{dN_A}{dt} = r_AV$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Equation 3)


where *dN<sub>A</sub>/dt* is the accumulation of moles of A in the reactor, *-r<sub>A</sub>* is the rate of disappearance of species A, and *V* is the reactor volume.

This mole balances (in equation 3) can be rearranged as follows

$\frac{1}{V} \frac{dN_A}{dt} = r_A$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Equation 4)


where the quantity

$\frac{N_A}{V} = C_A$ = the concentration of species A 

For a fixed volume reactor, this yields the result

$\frac{dC_A}{dt} = r_A$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Equation 5)


where a suitable rate law expression can be substituted for the variable *r<sub>A</sub>*.

It is through a combination of a mole balance, a rate law, and appropriate stoichiometry that an accurate reaction engineering solution may be obtained.
