This module describes and demonstrates some of the elementary thermophysical properties of interest in the study of fluid phases.  Here we perform a molecular dynamics simulation of a system of molecules interacting according to the Lennard-Jones model potential.  Properties calculated during the simulation include thermodynamic properties (the internal energy and the pressure), structural properties (the radial distribution function), and dynamic properties (the mean-square displacement as a function of time, and the velocity distribution).  The module permits variation of the system density and temperture to examine their effect on the fluid behavior as characterized by these properties.
