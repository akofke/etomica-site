Hookean Chains

Problem 1: Use the parameter setting of a = 0, b = 0, flow rate = 0, and chain length = 10.  Test the material properties given in Example 1 for Hookean chains by varying the shear rate for a given chain length.  Are the material functions independent of shear rate?

Problem 2: Test the chain length dependence of the material properties given in Example 1 for Hookean chains by varying the chain length at a fixed shear rate.  You will notice that longer chains take longer to come to steady state so you may wish to use several shorter chain lengths.

Problem 3: Use the parameter setting of a = 1, b = 0, flow rate = 0, and chain length = 10 from Example 2.  Varying the elongation from zero to the maximum rate you can obtain before the chain is pulled apart.  For a chain length of 10 beads make a plot of the three material functions.
