From the parameters considered in Example 1, change Îµ<sub>MonMon</sub> and set it equal to 0.10 k<sub>B</sub>T. Reduce the size of the simulation box to 25, and increase the length of the grafted chains to 40. How does the probability density distribution obtained under these conditions differ compared to what you obtained in Example 1? What is the driving force for the observed differences?
